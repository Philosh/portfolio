                      | Also , do note that the answer are not hardcoded in the UI. Rather, everytime we click the task tab, it sends a GET request to the
                      | router and the solution is recalculated and the answer is displayed. The idea was to include a section in the UI where user could input custom 
                      | parameters upto a certain limit but unfortunately due to limited time and late application of mine I could not implement that feature. However, it is worth noting that it would not be 
                      | a difficult task to do since the functions are written in a dynamic way meaning that they can take in any parameter value and the numbers are not hardcoded
                      | in the code.

                      | Regarding question 7 this web application itself could be considered one of the examples however it does lack front end finnesse. One of the projects I conducted 
                      | in my previous company was regarding satellite visualtion. You can get access to that project <a href ="https://saugatawale.com/satellite">here.</a> More details about it
