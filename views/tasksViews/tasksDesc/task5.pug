                    | 5. Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.
                    | Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420. We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a &quot;bouncy&quot; number; for example, 155349.
                    | Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy.

                    |In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.
                    | Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%. Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly n% where n = 99.
