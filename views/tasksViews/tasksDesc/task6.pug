                    | 6. In laser physics, a &quot;white cell&quot; is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.
                    | The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation 4x2 + y = 100
                    | The section corresponding to -0.01 &lt; x &le; +0.01 at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

                    | The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at
                    | (1.4,-9.6).
                    | Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection &quot;angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.&quot; That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.
                    | In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce.
                    | The slope m of the tangent line at any point (x,y) of the given ellipse is: m = -4x/y
                    | The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.
                    | The picture on the right shows the first few reflections of the beam.
                    | How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell before exiting?
